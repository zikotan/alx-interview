# 0x01-lockboxes

This repository contains a solution to the Lockboxes problem. The goal is to determine if all boxes in a list can be unlocked given that each box may contain keys to other boxes.

## Description

You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. The objective is to write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

### Prototype
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes)
